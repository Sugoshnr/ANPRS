# ANPRS
Automatic Number Plate Recognition System
This project can be implemented in closed circuit televisions to monitor vehicles and recognizing their number plates.
I have uploaded two versions of the project.
Qt enabled machines can use it to obtain a Graphical User Interface for ease of understanding.
The code is written in C++ integrated with OpenCV.
